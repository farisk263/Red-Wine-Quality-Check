# Classification using Deep Neural Network on Red Wine Quality (Team TensirFlow)
## **Introduction**

This project are managed by a team of 5 peoples as an evaluation for Certified Deep Learning Engineer course. Our team was tasked on using Deep Neural Network on structured data to solved it as a regression or classification problem.

## **Problem Statement**
The intricacies of deciding a fine wine when your selecting a dish to pair it with and whether to judge the quality of a certain wine for the massess could be easier for the somilier. 

## **The Idea**
It is better if we can in some way, use machine learning to help predict the quality of wine by the thousands of barrel by just taking in it chemical data.
